# LDC: Lightweight Dense CNN for Edge Detection (In construction)
With the same purpose and features as [DexiNed](https://github.com/xavysp/DexiNed), LDC is a straightforward CNN based model
for edge detection. LDC has just ~0.7M parameters, it can reduce your time of training and testing. This model is trained
only on datasets prepared for edge detection [BIPED](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xavysp/biped), 
[MDBD](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/edge-detection-on-mdbd), and 
[RINDNet](https://github.com/MengyangPu/RINDNet)---we have prepared this dataset here
[BRIND](https://github.com/xavysp/BRIND).
Before using this repo, we highly recommend read our paper in 
[LDC: Lightweight Dense CNN for Edge Detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9807316).

```

## Test

In dataset.py you will find most of the dataset used in edge, contour, and boundary detection.
If you have your own dataset copy and paste in data folder and run the code bellow
    
    python main.py --choose_test_data=-1

## Train

Check the dateset you have for training, set them in dataset.py and main.py---line 216-350. Then
run the following code:

    python main.py
